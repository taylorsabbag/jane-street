# Jane Street Puzzles Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to [Jane Street's monthly puzzles](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/). Jane Street publishes interesting mathematical and programming puzzles each month, and this repository documents my approaches to solving them.

## About Jane Street Puzzles

Jane Street, a quantitative trading firm, releases a new puzzle on the first of each month. These puzzles are diverse in nature, including:

- Mathematical reasoning
- Programming challenges
- Logic puzzles
- Game theory
- Probability problems
- Visual/geometric puzzles

Each puzzle offers a unique challenge that often requires creative problem-solving approaches.

## Repository Structure

Each puzzle solution is contained in its own directory, named in the format:
`MMM[YYYY]-PuzzleName` (e.g., `Oct2024-KnightMoves6`)

A typical solution directory contains:

- `README.md` - Problem description and solution explanation and collaboration notes
- `index.js` - Implementation of the solution (for programming puzzles)
- Additional files as needed (helper modules, test cases, etc.)

## Note on Puzzle Solutions for Current Puzzles

To avoid spoiling the current month's puzzle for others, the solution for the most recent puzzle is not included in this repository until the next puzzle is released. Solutions for all previous months' puzzles are available.

## Technologies Used

Solutions are implemented using:

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Custom helper modules for common puzzle-solving utilities

## Acknowledgments

- [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) for providing these engaging puzzles
